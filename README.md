# code-jeopardy

## Project Details

The code jeopardy is a project showing my skills in javascript. In the application files you will find html, css and javascript files all making up
the foundation of the application.

##Functionality
Upon accessing the web page the user is faced with instructions on taking the quiz and it's scoring. once the user moves through the quiz answering 
questions they will be informed whether their answer is correct or incorrect. If the user answers correctly there is not penalty applied. If the 
user answers incorrectly a penalty of 15 seconds is taken off of the clock. If the user fails to answer all questions in the time given then the 
user is taken to the end screen where they may input their initials and score(time left on clock).
